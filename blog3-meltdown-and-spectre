-protect by keeping your software up to date
-download from trusted sources.
-patches are released to help protect against these security issues but can cause your computers to slow down about 30%.
--particularly for programs that require a lot of requests to a kernel.
-Spectre patch fixes are a more burden to industry(it is a vulnerability rather than a bug).
-older processors are more impactful than newer ones
-(an official statement)Microsoft said that consumer devices with processors from 2015 or earlier running Windows 7, 8, and 10  would be more likely to exhibit slowdowns.
-Intel is trying hard to fix the bugs but currently significant performance drops are recorded.
-critical infrastructures have not yet deployed the patches considering the performance issues 
-The bigger complication will be identifying all of vulnerable devices, and making sure patches reach them eventually
-data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated execution.

-meltdown and spectre are two of the security flaws in very basic design of a CPU chip.
-meltdown allows a hacker to see through the small memory that should be inaccessible by the non permitted program snippet.

-Difficult to implement by an app running locally(MAC-IOS).

-google products that are safe:
-Search, YouTube, Google Ads products, Maps, Blogger, and other services), and the customer data held by Google, G Suite (e.g., Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, and other G Suite services) is protected.
-on android platform difficult and limited
-on chrome use site isolation
-chrome 64 to be released on 23 jan will include mitigations
-install security patches for CPU at earliest.
-We just want folks – particularly cloud subscribers and IT admins – to be aware of the effects
-retpoline from google is a patch for meltdown
-64-bit pcs are will get less performance hit as compared to 32 bit systems

-can be exploited by java script running in a web browser.
-spectre forces a software to make a compromise and then beign used to see what's going on.
-apple watch is unaffected by both.
-main cause is speculative execution.
-Kernel page table isolation is a method of seperating the two address spaces for kernel and user processes thus preventing the exploitation of the security bug
- this context-switch from user processes to kernel context takes time because it requires a complete reloading of the page tables.
-it also flushes all the cache causing a further performance hit.
-more on IO and system call related programs
-with PCID all TLB entries need not to be flushed and can be retained in the processor
-most kernel machines do not include this PCID feature.
-In other words, if you're seeing crap performance after applying these fixes, look at your kernel configuration and get PCID enabled  – if the hardware feature is present in your chipset.


- If the address is sufficiently cached, the load loads the data stored at the
   given address, without respecting the privilege level.
   Instructions that depend on the load are executed.
   This is the vulnerable case.

-affects almost all processors and cpus
-cyber criminals use side channels to sniff data.
-hard to mimic
-perfect timings are required.
-meltdown program enters highly secure kernel space.
